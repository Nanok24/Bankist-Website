# Bankist - Presentation website for the simple banking application

This project I've learned a lot about how the DOM works behind the scenes, about the types of events and what event propagation is (how to use it to my advantage), DOM traversing and I've also learned how to build a couple of widely used modern web development elements: tabbed component, sticky navigation bar, revealing elements on scroll (with the Intersection Observer API), lazy loading images and a slider component.

### Credits

This is a project that was made during my learning process of JS, following Jonas Schmedtmann's (https://codingheroes.io/) course for javaScript. Credits to him for this idea and the provided structure.
